Have an in-person interview tomorrow with them... it's an hour one way damn.

Possible I gotta take a tollway too and pay.

Anyway I fumbled some questions on the first interview but made it here so I'll review those questions and review some more.

I could have spent more time on this but I was trying to finish the CBP parser for Turbo Tax since I have over 5K rows to deal with.

I've spent the last like 3 days on that, and more... I did procrastinate though since I started on it like two weeks ago.

Questions I had problems with:

- class vs. functional components in react

- shadow dom (I said idk)

- useRef "mechanism to access actual element"

- monolith vs. microservices

All topics to cover:

- full stack
- react
- typescript or node
- heavy api experience
- data-orm
- data messaging, sqs
- redux
- rest api
- jest
- swagger
