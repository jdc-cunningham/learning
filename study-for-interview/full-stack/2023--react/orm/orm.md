> abstraction layer between application and database

align programming code with database structures

abstraction

address, access and manipulate objects without touching data

active record vs. data mapper pattern

prettier way to access data vs. using raw SQL

only ones I've used are prisma and eloquent (long time ago)

model only in one place, DRY

forces you to write MVC

model is weakly bound to application

mapping: bridge between objects and tables
