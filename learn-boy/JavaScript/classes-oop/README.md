### About
Just brushing up on this in case I need it.

### OOP review
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_programming

- objects, properties
- "do" methods
- instance, constructor uses class template to create instance/new
  - constructor is inside the class right
- inheritance
  - use some class (super/parent) as a base with shared properties/methods and then modify it
  - polymorphism
    - method has same name but does different things/override
- encapsulation
  - private vs. public
  - nice to have for changing stuff inside/not updating elsewhere
  - DRY
- method defined in constructor's prototype property, all objects using this constructor have this method
Classes -> objects



### JS Classes
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Classes_in_JavaScript

"set up a prototype chain" hmm

constructor - special method of class for creating and initializing an object instance of that class.

constructor can be omitted for default constructor

Doing challenge here
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Test_your_skills:_Object-oriented_JavaScript

super call in extended class passes param back to original super class/matches that param count
