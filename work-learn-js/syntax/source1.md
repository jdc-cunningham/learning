4 links to go through, napped, late start

IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic neat

mantissa, floating point number

how does 52-bit go to 9+15...

modulo division with decimal results in decimal result huh

```
1 << 2; // 4 (zero fill left shift) 
```

bitwise operation

so what... 1 becomes 100 which is 4

follows PEMDAS

Infinity is a value

**interesting** (array adding

"Hello " + ["world", "1"] -> "Hello world,!"

that's whack

type coercion

== is roughly the same, === is exact, not the same

related to being able to add different things, concats or number adds based on context

null, deliberate non-value
undefined, not currently present

falsy

**interesting** (global scope)

not using var prefix means global scope

no value, undefined

do while is nice

**interesting** (labeled loop)

breaking outer loop, not entirely sure I get it

these are "labels", you put them above the for loop and can break by specifying which one

**interesting** (return semicolon)

automatically adds semicolon if linebreak present after return

logic blocks don't have scopes, variable defined inside exists globally

**note worthy**

closures

inner function has access to outer function scope

**interesting** this bind bit

don't really understand it

`__proto___`

add more functionality to something existing like String

**ES6**

let lexical scope

var is functional scope

lambda syntax, (fat arrow)

**interesting**

lambda cannot be called before the definition
