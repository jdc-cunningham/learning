I have Chrome, I do spend time in Firefox should make one there too

For note taking

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension

simple and works

the "until firefox restarts" part sucks but it doesn't need to be a legit extension/I rarely restart firefox

I'm concerned with the performance though, clicking around settings I see the spinner beach ball
