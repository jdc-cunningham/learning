I'm following through the [learncpp website](https://www.learncpp.com/). I donated $100 to this site since I'm using an adblocker. I'm going to learn this with QT.

I'm using VS Code... I was trying Visual Studio Community but the solution thing got annoying. Want to compile single files.

I followed the instructions here with [MinGW](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp).

Use `ctrl + shift + b` to have the build come up. Choose the `g++` version and it makes an `exe` with same name.
